# Hi!
'Sup? My names HunnyBon (Github "sirmentio"), and I like to program,
among other things. I enjoy videogames of most kinds, and ways
to modify them.

## Stuff about me

- üíï I like community to be held as high as code.
  - The people are as important as the code made by them.
  - If someone doesn't enjoy a community they won't make good code.
  - Anything less wouldn't be fun!


- üé® I like to make art.
  - I suppose icons count as art?
  - If I could grasp music theory I'd make so much music alongside code.
  - You could say any program is a piece of art.


- üìù I like to write.
  - Code, of course.
  - But also just write in general.
  - Worldbuilding makes me giddy.
